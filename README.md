# SeqUDAS: Sequence Upload and Data Archiving System

## Overview

Modern DNA sequencing machines generate several gigabytes (GB) of data per run. Organizing and archiving this data presents a challenge for small labs. We present a Sequence Upload and Data Archiving System (SeqUDAS) that aims to ease the task of maintaining a sequence data repository through process automation and an intuitive web interface.

## Features

- Automated upload and storage of sequence data to a central storage server.
- Data validation with MD5 checksums for data integrity assurance
- Display of quality control data through a mobile-friendly web interface
- Secure authentication and account-based access controls
- Integration with MultiQC for detailed quality control info for each sample
- Pass sequence data along to another remote server via API (IRIDA) (other remote links possible in future?)
